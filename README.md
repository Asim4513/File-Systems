# File-Systems

• Developed a program for verifying file system integrity, focusing on inode validation, address verification, and directory structure.
• Implemented checks for correct inode classification, address usage in inodes, and root directory configuration.
• Cross-referenced in-use inode addresses with bitmap entries and ensured unique usage of direct and indirect addresses.
• Ensured consistency in inode references within directories and accurate reference counts for file links.
• Incorporated rules to maintain directory uniqueness and prevent multiple links.
